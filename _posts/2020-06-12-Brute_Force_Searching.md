<u>`Brute Force Searching`</u> strategy is a useful problem-solving approach that *systematically enumerates* *all possible candidates* for the solution and then selecting the proper candidates as the result set. <!--more-->

## Introduction

It is usually used to *search* all possible results for a specific problem, and if there are *overlapping* subproblems, <u>`Greedy`</u> or <u>`Dynamic Programming`</u> skills can be applied based on the brute force process to get optimal solutions.

<u>`Backtracking`</u> and <u>`Branch and Bound`</u> are two strategies for applying the Brute Force Searching approach to find all the solutions. Those two methods are also as known as *`DFS`* and *`BFS`* strategy separately. 

Before we dive into more details of them, letâ€™s familiar with two useful techniques for utilizing those strategies. The first thing is called <u>`State Space Tree`</u>, which can represent all possible solutions using a tree structure in which successive states of an instance are considered. The second is <u>`Bounding Function`</u>, it is nothing but conditions to terminate invalid nodes in the tree so that the desired candidates are selected for goals and killing unnecessary branches of the tree to save time.

## Backtracking

The logic of `Backtracking` is that searching from the root of a state space tree to get all the promising leaves which are the results meeting the constrains. 

1. Firstly, take one element from the given pool, and 

2. Then, checking the bounding function (conditions) to see if current exploration can go further. 

3. If OK, then take one of the remaining elements from the pool to generate an intermediate result, and then repeat #2, until reaching the end of the tree.

4. After traversing this leaf, we need to go back to the previous step, so we should remove this point added to the result.

Below is an example of applying backtracking method to get all possible results.

As the above figure showing, the state space tree displays how `Backtracking` method working and obvious itâ€™s a type of `DFS` strategy and using bounding function to prune the tree.

- `DFS`: `pre-order` occurs when making choice from pool to select an element, and `post-order` occurs when revoking the choice.

- Pruning state space tree to avoid useless searching before `pre-order` operation and adding current path into the result set. 

The `Backtracking` can be broken down into following two parts in pseudocode

```python
def backtrack(current_path, depth, pool):
  # 0. base case
  if depth reaches the bottom:
    if current_path is a promising path: solutions.append(current_path)
		return 
  # 1. visiting all nodes in state space tree
  for element in pool:
    if element is not a valid choice: continue
    else: 
      current_path.append(element) # make choice
      backtrack(current_path, depth + 1, pool) # go to next depth
      current_path.pop(element) # move back, cancelling the choice
```

The difference between traditional `DFS` and the above pseudocode is that how to avoid visiting elements that have been searched. Actually, the way how an element is selected from the pool and the validation of the currently selected element can complete such a thing. Here are some exercises for this patternðŸ¤“

## Branch and bound

Another strategy using brute force searching is `Branch and Bound`, which follows `BFS` pattern to find [all possible] candidates of the solution. The logic is similar with `BFS`, we start from the root of state space tree and put that element into a queue to generate next level nodes and exploring breadthwise. The following figure shows an instance that how `BFS` works to get the answer.

This method is often used to find a possible shortest path, and what modifications are needed is the bounding functions. If you want to assess your understanding,  please check thisðŸ‘‰:
