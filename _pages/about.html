<h1>Welcome to Weiwei's Tech Blog!</h1>

<p>
Hello, my name is <strong>Weiwei Cao</strong>. Currently, I’m a graduate student major in <strong>Master of Applied Computing (Computer Science)</strong> at the University of Windsor, ON, Canada, and seeking co-op opportunities starting from September 2020. Before that, I have achieved a master’s degree in <strong>Management Science and Engineering</strong> in China.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been worked as a software and e-commerce product manager for around 7 years in China. During that time, I’ve become <strong>a motivated and goal-oriented analytical business professional</strong>. I’m capable to <strong>own and manage software development</strong> and <strong>communicate with cross-functional departments</strong> and <strong>combine technical depth with client demands, marketing goals, analytics, and software lifecycle management skills</strong>.
